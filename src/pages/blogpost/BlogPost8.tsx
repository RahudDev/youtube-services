    <h1 className="mb-4 fw-bold">Understanding YouTube Monetization Rules</h1>
    <p className="text-muted">August 3, 2025</p>
    <p>
      YouTube monetization is one of the most appealing aspects of content creation. However, earning money from the platform comes with its own set of rules and criteria that every creator must understand and follow. In 2025, the monetization landscape has evolved to be both more accessible and more regulated.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">1. The Basics: Meeting the Threshold</h3>
    <p>
      To become eligible for monetization, you must be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). This requires:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 1,000 subscribers</li>
      <li>Over 4,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months</li>
      <li>A linked AdSense account</li>
      <li>No active community strikes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once approved, you gain access to revenue from ads, Super Chats, memberships, and more.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">2. Monetization-Friendly Content</h3>
    <p>
      YouTube enforces strict policies about what kind of content can be monetized. Videos that include hate speech, excessive violence, harmful pranks, or sexually suggestive content are either demonetized or restricted.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">3. Understanding Ad Suitability</h3>
    <p>
      YouTube uses machine learning and manual reviews to evaluate whether a video is suitable for all advertisers. Using proper titles, thumbnails, and tags that honestly reflect your content helps avoid demonetization.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">4. Staying Compliant with Copyright Laws</h3>
    <p>
      Avoid using copyrighted material (like music or clips) without permission. YouTube’s Content ID system can flag or remove videos that violate copyright, which affects your revenue and credibility.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">5. Diversifying Your Revenue</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond ads, smart creators in 2025 are also making money through sponsorships, affiliate marketing, selling digital products, and launching online courses. These not only boost income but reduce reliance on YouTube’s ad algorithm.
    </p>
    <h3 className="fw-semibold mt-4">6. Keeping Track of Policy Updates</h3>
    <p>
      YouTube regularly updates its monetization policies. Stay informed by checking Creator Insider videos and the official YouTube blog. Ignorance isn’t an excuse if your channel gets flagged.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4">
      Understanding and playing by YouTube’s rules is essential for long-term success. Treat your channel like a business—follow the guidelines, create high-quality content, and explore multiple income streams. Monetization is a marathon, not a sprint.
